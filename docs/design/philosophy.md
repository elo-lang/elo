# Building software intuitively

Elo is a systems compiled programming language. Designed so developers create amazing things in a reliable and enjoyable way: readable syntax, a deliberately small standard library, and predictable behavior. It aims to remove ceremony and friction so you can focus on expressing intent rather than wrestling toolchain complexity.

The word _Elo_ means "chain link" in Portuguese. We chose the name to reflect the language's design goals: simple, well-crafted pieces that connect together into robust systems. Elo aims to be a small link in your toolchain — clear, composable, and intentional.

## Minimalism that respects interoperability and clarity
The language favors a debloated core and a straightforward compilation process, producing clear, low-level output and enabling interoperability when needed. Elo is made to be predictable: a tool that prioritizes developer clarity and robust systems programming over feature bloat.

## Simple... But also **intuitive**
When designing this language, we always try to make each design choice as intuitive and easy to reason about as possible. You shouldn't need to memorize complicated rules or consult pages of documentation to accomplish common tasks — Elo prefers consistent, obvious behavior so you can build confidently and quickly.
