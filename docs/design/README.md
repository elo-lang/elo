# Elo Language Design Docs

This series of documents is meant to be a brainstorming whiteboard, any information in these documents are not certain.

Design documentation is not meant to be any kind of final specification of release documentation. This is the temporary specification of Elo's design
characteristics and systems for what we plan in the moment for the language.

## Table of contents
If you are interested in knowing about what this language **really** is, please read these
markdown documents in order.

1. [`introduction.md`](./introduction.md): Explains what Elo really aims to be as an useful tool for developers.
1. [`basic.md`](./basic.md): Describes the basic features of the language (fns, structs, enums, control flow, etc.) and its differences from other programming languages.
1. [`typing.md`](./typing.md): Description about the use of the primitive and other types available to the user and how Elo handles them.
1. [`patmatching.md`](./patmatching.md): Specification of how Elo will feature **pattern matching** using the language's typing system.
1. [`amm.md`](./amm.md): Specifies the memory management system we named **AMM** (stands for Assisted Memory Management) that will be implemented in this language and is supposed to be its main selling point.
