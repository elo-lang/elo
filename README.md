# Elo
Building software intuitively

> **WARNING**: Elo is not a finished language. There's no warranty of this piece of software. **Use it at your own risk**.

## The idea
Elo is a **compiled programming language** designed to
allow developers to **build software intuitively**, without having to deal with too
complex programming knowledge often associated with (or even required by)
modern compiled programming languages.

## Development
Elo is in its early stages of development, we are still brainstorming a lot.
This repository contains the source code of Elo's compiler.

## Getting started
The compiler is implemented in [**Rust**](https://rust-lang.org/).
You need to use [**cargo**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) to build the project.

- Windows
  * Run cargo to compile from source
    ```console
    > cd path\to\elo
    > cargo build --release
    ```
- Linux/MacOS
  * Run cargo to compile from source
    ```console
    $ cd ./path/to/elo
    $ cargo build --release
    ```
