# Oxido
Compiled programming language for computers.

## The idea
The idea of Oxido is to be a simple programming language made to
build software in a more intuitive way, without having to deal with
complex programming knowledge often associated (or even required) with
modern compiled programming languages.

The language is designed to have a clean and concise syntax,
but still have most part (or even the same amount) of
performance and reliability when compared with other compiled programming languages.
