# Oxido
Building software intuitively

## The idea
Oxido is to be a **simple programming language** designed to
allow developers to **build software intuitively**, without having to deal with too
complex programming knowledge often associated with (or even required by)
modern compiled programming languages.

The language has the goal to have a **clean and objective syntax**, but still have most part
(or even the same amount) of performance and reliability when compared
with other compiled programming languages.

## Development
Oxido is in its early stages of development, we are still brainstorming a lot.

This repository contains the source code of Oxido's compiler.

## Getting started
The compiler is implemented in [**Rust**](https://rust-lang.org/).

You need to use [**cargo**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) to build the project.

- Windows
  * Run cargo to compile from source
    ```console
    > cd path\to\oxido
    > cargo build --release
    ```
- Linux/MacOS
  * Run cargo to compile from source
    ```console
    $ cd ./path/to/oxido
    $ cargo build --release
    ```
