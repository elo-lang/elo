<p align=center><strong><em>Building software intuitively.</em></strong></p>

> **Elo** is a systems compiled programming language 
> designed to allow developers enjoy software development 
> through a **simple syntax**, **debloated standard library** 
> and an **intuitive experience** in general. 

## Development
Elo is in its early stages of development, we are still brainstorming a lot.
This repository contains the source code of Elo's compiler.

## Getting started

> **WARNING**: Elo is not a finished language. There's no warranty of this piece of software. **Use it at your own risk**.

The compiler is implemented in [**Rust**](https://rust-lang.org/).
You need to use [**cargo**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) to build the project.

- Windows
  * Run cargo to compile from source
    ```console
    > cd path\to\elo
    > cargo build --release
    ```

- Linux/MacOS
  * Run cargo to compile from source
    ```console
    $ cd ./path/to/elo
    $ cargo build --release
    ```
